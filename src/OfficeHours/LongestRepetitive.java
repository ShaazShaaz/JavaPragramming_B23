        Longest Repetitive Substring -- Real Interview Task


            Write a program if some substring K that can be repeated N>1 times to produce
             the input string exactly as it appears.
            Your program should return longest substring K, and
            if there is none it should be return "There is no repetitive substring"

            For Example is str ="abcababcababcab"                 output should be abcab
                           str ="abcdefabcdef"                    output should be abcdef
                           str ="abcdefabcdefabcdefabcdef"     output should be abcdefabcdef
                           str ="abcdefxabcdef"                   output should be "There is no
                           repetitive substring"
         */
    }
